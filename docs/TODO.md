# TODO - Beheader

The open work, and nothing else. `STATUS.md` describes the code that exists,
and this file names the changes nobody has made yet.

Take an item, build it with its tests, run the four checks in `CLAUDE.md`, and
delete the item when it lands. Do not rewrite it into a record of the work.
Git holds what was done, and this file holds what is left.

[RUST_PORT.md](RUST_PORT.md) holds the Rust engine migration and its stable
work register. The spec has released that scope, so those packages are active
now, and they stay tracked there rather than here. Take a port package from
that register, not from this file.

A new item names the change, gives the reason, and says how a reader will know
it is finished. Anything else is a note, and a note belongs in the header of
the file it is about.

## Open

Nothing is open here. The next product item comes from the spec, by the route
below. The next engine item is the active package in `RUST_PORT.md`.

## Where the next items come from

Section 17 of `SPEC.md` lists what the team postponed on purpose. That list is
the boundary of the work, and an item moves here only when the spec releases
it. Python execution behind `evaluateScriptOutput` is the largest of them, and
section 11 of the spec holds the seam it arrives through.

An item that the spec does not cover needs the spec first. Write the
requirement there, then open the item here.
